0.1-20191224:

0.1-20170615:
* Worked on #39 (Fix bug after using the context properties menu (e.g. changing 
  the label in the context menu's props makes the fixed props panel responseless.)
  PROBLEM: ProcessObject.getPropertyEditor() always returns the same instance
           of the editor. If the same instance of a component is used in
           multiple views, this might lead to the observed problems.

           This cannot be easily fixed, since all ProcessModels work like this. 

           Solution (1): A better way would be, if ProcessModels just
           reference the static type of the editor and optional parameters,
           so that getPropertyEditor(reuse-identifier) might create a new
           instance for every fresh reuse-identifier...

           Solution (2): Introduce an abstract clone() method in 
           PropertyEditor - creates a lot of garbage.

           Solution (3): Introduce an abstract getPropertyEditor(reuse-id)
           that uses solution (2) internally but maps it to a HashMap. The
           always created PropertyEditor is used as a template for copy.
